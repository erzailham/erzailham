### Hi there 👋

I am an iOS developer with a passion for creating intuitive and high-quality apps. 

My expertise lies in native iOS development using **Swift**🦅 and **Objective-C**, as well as **hybrid** development with **React Native**⚛️.. 

Since 2013, I have had the opportunity to work in the startup world as a software engineer, where I have gained valuable experience in helping to develop and launch successful apps. 

Currently, I am grateful to be working as an iOS developer at [Aleph Labs](https://aleph-labs.com), where I continue to learn and grow in my field.
